## BACKEND

### Guidelines for PYTHON

#### FASTAPI

- Use Pydantic models for request and response validation with strict type checking and custom validators
- Implement dependency injection for services and database sessions to improve testability and resource management
- Use async endpoints for I/O-bound operations to improve throughput for {{high_load_endpoints}}
- Leverage FastAPI's background tasks for non-critical operations that don't need to block the response
- Implement proper exception handling with HTTPException and custom exception handlers for {{error_scenarios}}
- Use path operation decorators consistently with appropriate HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, etc.)


## DATABASE

### Guidelines for SUPABASE

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.
- Use supabase from context.locals in Astro routes instead of importing supabaseClient directly
- Use SupabaseClient type from `src/db/supabase.client.ts`, not from `@supabase/supabase-js`
